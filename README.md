# Guillaume-U2IS-2024
This repository contains my work as an intern at the U2IS Research Lab at ENSTA Paris in 2024. It includes my projects, along with the code and documentation developed during my internship, focusing on texture classification for unsupervised robotic navigation in unstructured terrain using vision and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data.
